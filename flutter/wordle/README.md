# Flutter Wordle — Guess. Tap. Win.

Welcome to Flutter Wordle, a fun little clone of the classic Wordle game — rebuilt with Flutter magic, clean UI, and smooth animations.
If you love puzzles (and coding), you’re in the right place. 😄

## Features

-  Classic Wordle gameplay — Guess the 5-letter word in 6 tries

-  Custom on-screen keyboard

-  Fast & responsive UI

-  Runs on Android, iOS, and Web

-  Color feedback just like the original (green, yellow, grey)

## How It Works

1. Type your guess using the custom keyboard

2. Hit ENTER

3. Watch your tiles flip and reveal if you're a genius or… almost there 😉

4. Keep going until you win (or Flutter judges you 👀)


## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Frontend + UI)

- Material Design

- Stateful widgets (your favorite 😄)

- Custom logic for:

    - Word validation

    - Tile coloring

    - Keyboard feedback

## Why I Built This

Just sharpening my Flutter skills, experimenting with layouts, keyboards, animation, and game logic — and having fun while at it.
Also, who doesn’t like Wordle?
